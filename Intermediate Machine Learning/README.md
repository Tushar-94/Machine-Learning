# 🚀 Intermediate Machine Learning
A practical guide to building smarter, cleaner, and more powerful machine learning models.

## 📌 Overview
Real-world datasets are messy, noisy, and full of challenges. This notebook steps beyond beginner-friendly ML and shows the intermediate-level techniques every data scientist must master to build reliable, high-performing models.

From advanced preprocessing to powerful models like XGBoost, this notebook covers essential skills for working with complex datasets and improving model performance.

## 📚 What We Will Learn

### 🧩 1. Handling Real-World Data Types
Modern datasets contain missing values and categorical features.
In this notebook, we explore:
- Three strategies for handling missing values
- What categorical variables are
- Three practical approaches for encoding categorical data
- How preprocessing choices impact model performance

### 🛠️ 2. Building ML Pipelines
Pipelines help you write clean, reproducible, production-ready machine learning workflows.
We’ll learn how to:
- Combine preprocessing + modeling steps
- Avoid mistakes caused by manual transformations
- Improve code quality and experiment faster

### ✔️ 3. Advanced Model Validation (Cross-Validation)
Simple train-test splits can give misleading results.
Here we cover:
- Why cross-validation provides more reliable performance estimates
- How to implement it using scikit-learn
- When and why to use different validation strategies

### 🌲 4. Building State-of-the-Art Models with XGBoost
XGBoost is one of the most accurate ML algorithms for structured/tabular data.
This notebook work on:
- What gradient boosting is
- How XGBoost improves prediction accuracy
- How to train, tune, and optimize XGBoost models
- Why it dominates Kaggle competitions

### ⚠️ 5. Avoiding Data Leakage
Data leakage silently destroys models by giving them information they shouldn’t have during training.
We cover:
- What leakage is
- How it ruins model performance in subtle ways
- How to detect and prevent it
- Best practices for safe modeling pipelines
- This is one of the most important topics for any practicing data scientist.
